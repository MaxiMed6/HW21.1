        <h2>Saving people, hunting things, the family business</h2>
        <p> You wanna know who I am? Fine. I'll tell you. I'm Dean Winchester. I'm the guy who saved the world a few times, but I'm also the guy who screwed it up more times than I can count. I'm a hunter. I kill the things that go bump in the night so you can sleep safe in your beds. That’s my job, my life... my curse.
            But you know what? It’s more than that. It’s a family business. It’s me and my brother, Sam, riding the highways in a '67 Impala, fighting whatever hell throws at us. And yeah, we’ve lost people. Too many. Mom. Dad. Friends. Sometimes it feels like the universe is just taking potshots at us, seeing how much we can take before we break. But we don’t. We get back up. Every. Damn. Time.
            I’ve made mistakes—big ones. I’ve lied, cheated, stolen. I’ve let people down, hurt the ones I love, and sometimes I don’t know if I’m the good guy or just some idiot with a hero complex. But here’s the thing: I keep going. Not because I’m fearless. Hell no. I’m scared every day. Scared of losing Sam. Scared of failing. Scared of what’s waiting for me at the end of the road.
            But fear doesn’t stop me. You see, the world’s not fair, it’s not easy, and it sure as hell doesn’t owe me a thing. But I’ll be damned if I let it win. I’ll fight until my last breath, not because I think I can save everyone, but because it’s the right thing to do. </p>
           
           <p> So yeah, I’m Dean Winchester. I’m not perfect, and I sure as hell don’t have all the answers. But I’ve got a car, a brother, and a purpose. And for me, that’s enough."</p>
