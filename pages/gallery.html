            <p>This here? This is Baby. She’s a 1967 Chevy Impala, sleek, black, and built to take on the end of the world. She’s got a V8 engine that roars like a lion and enough muscle to leave most rides in the dust. Her chrome trim gleams like a hunter’s knife under moonlight, and those bench seats? Classic American comfort.</p>
            <p>But she’s more than just a car. She’s got a soul, you know? Every scratch, every dent—those are badges of honor, stories of hunts and battles. The leather smells like old whiskey and gunpowder, and the trunk? Let’s just say it’s fully stocked for the family business—rock salt, holy water, and enough firepower to make a demon think twice.</p>
                <p>She’s home. My sanctuary on four wheels. A place where me and Sam have fought, laughed, and patched each other up. She’s the one constant in all this chaos. When you’re behind that wheel, listening to Zeppelin or Metallica, nothing else matters. She’s not just a car—she’s a damn legend</p>
